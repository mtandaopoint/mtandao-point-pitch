  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Over 20 million Tanzanians are still offline due to unaffordable internet costs and poor infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. This digital exclusion limits access to essential services such as education, healthcare, finance, and civic participation.</p>
  <p>Key challenges include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unreliable Connectivity:</strong> High costs and limited internet infrastructure hinder digital access in rural communities.</li>
    <li><strong>Lack of Digital Identity:</strong> More than 15 million Tanzanians lack a formal digital identity, making it difficult to access essential services such as banking and healthcare.</li>
    <li><strong>Financial Exclusion:</strong> Many rural communities have limited access to mobile banking and mobile money services, further deepening economic disparities.</li>
  </ul>
  
</section>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>Our Solution</h2>
  <p>MTANDAO POINT addresses the key challenges of digital exclusion, lack of digital identity, and financial inaccessibility in rural Tanzania by providing an integrated, community-driven platform.</p>
  <p>Our solution combines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Affordable Connectivity:</strong> Solar-powered mesh Wi-Fi networks to deliver internet access even in remote villages.</li>
    <li><strong>Blockchain-Based Digital Identity:</strong> Secure, decentralized digital identities using Hyperledger technology to give individuals control over their personal data and improve access to services.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Money Integration:</strong> Collaboration with mobile money providers (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, NMB) to offer financial services, including microloans, mobile payments, and digital wallets.</li>
    <li><strong>Community-Driven Governance:</strong> Local councils and community members will manage and maintain the infrastructure, ensuring sustainability and ownership.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
  <p>Tanzania’s rural sector shows strong potential for digital inclusion:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TAM: 55M+ Tanzanians in need of digital services</li>
    <li>SAM: 30M rural residents with limited digital tools</li>
    <li>SOM: 3.75M reachable in 15 rural districts (3-year target)</li>
    <li>Key sectors: 8M school-age children, 65% farming population, 55% unbanked adults</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="image-placeholder">[Insert visual: TAM/SAM/SOM chart or market size visual]</div>
</section> -->

<section class="slide">
  <h2>Market and Demand</h2>
  <p>Tanzania and East Africa have a strong unmet demand for affordable, inclusive digital services—especially in rural areas. MTANDAO POINT directly addresses this gap with localized connectivity and financial access.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Total Addressable Market (TAM):</strong> 55M+ Tanzanians offline or digitally excluded (TCRA, 2023)</li>
    <li><strong>Serviceable Available Market (SAM):</strong> 30M+ rural residents, including 8M school-age children and 65% of the farming population</li>
    <li><strong>Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):</strong> 3.75M reachable in 15 districts within 3 years through community-led rollouts</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Demand is further driven by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High mobile penetration but low internet access due to high data costs</li>
    <li>Majority of rural adults lacking digital ID and financial inclusion</li>
    <li>Growing national agenda for digital transformation and youth employment</li>
  </ul>
  
</section>


<section class="slide">
  <h2>Business Model</h2>
  <p>MTANDAO POINT operates on a blended model of affordability, social impact, and local empowerment to ensure long-term sustainability:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pay-as-you-go Access:</strong> Users pay TZS 1,000/day for unlimited internet, designed to be affordable for low-income rural users.</li>
    <li><strong>Subsidized Access:</strong> Special plans for schools, women-led enterprises, and farmer groups to boost inclusive access.</li>
    <li><strong>Revenue Sharing:</strong> Profits are shared with village councils to support local governance and reinvestment in community priorities.</li>
    <li><strong>Startup & Scale Funding:</strong> Initial support from grants, social investors, and UCSAF; long-term scale via user revenues and strategic partnerships.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Add-ons:</strong> Digital ID issuance, mobile money facilitation, training programs, and access to public services provide additional revenue streams and value.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Traction</h2>
    <p>MTANDAO POINT has moved from concept to implementation, generating early momentum and community engagement:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pilot Deployed:</strong> Operational in Ng’ong’ona village with solar-powered mesh Wi-Fi and over 30 active daily users.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Adoption:</strong> Strong uptake among youth, women, and small business owners for learning, trading, and communication.</li>
      <li><strong>MoUs in Progress:</strong> Formal discussions underway with Vodacom and Airtel for bandwidth partnerships and rural expansion.</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional Interest:</strong> Endorsements and inquiries from regional officials, NGOs, and digital inclusion advocates.</li>
      <li><strong>Visibility & Validation:</strong> Selected for the UN Citiverse Challenge 2025; featured as a model for grassroots digital inclusion.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

<section class="slide">
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>MTANDAO POINT leverages local infrastructure, solar energy, and inclusive governance to deliver sustainable connectivity and digital empowerment in rural Tanzania.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. Connectivity:</strong> We partner with ISPs to purchase wholesale bandwidth and distribute it through solar-powered mesh networks using TP-Link and LibreRouter hardware.</li>
    <li><strong>2. Access:</strong> Users connect via affordable daily plans (TZS 1,000/day), with subsidized options for schools, farmers, and women’s groups.</li>
    <li><strong>3. Digital Identity:</strong> Residents are issued blockchain-based digital IDs (Hyperledger) for secure access to services and credit.</li>
    <li><strong>4. Financial Inclusion:</strong> Integration with mobile wallets (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, NMB) allows for seamless digital transactions.</li>
    <li><strong>5. Local Ownership:</strong> Communities manage and maintain networks, share revenues, and reinvest in local development (education, health, microloans).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This community-centric model ensures affordability, scalability, and resilience—empowering rural populations from the ground up.</p>
